Features
Multiple Modes: Integrated presets for Work (25 min), Short Break (5 min), and Long Break (15 min).

Dynamic Title Updates: The browser tab updates in real-time so users can track time while working in other tabs.

Session Tracking: A persistent counter that tracks how many work intervals have been completed.

Responsive Design: A mobile-friendly interface built with modern CSS Flexbox.

Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic markup for accessibility.

CSS3: Custom properties (variables) and transitions for a smooth UI.

JavaScript (ES6): Logic for setInterval management, DOM manipulation, and state handling.

Technical Challenges & Learning
State Management: Learned how to cleanly switch between different timer states (Work vs. Break) without overlapping intervals.

Interval Accuracy: Explored the nuances of the JavaScript event loop and how setInterval behaves in the browser.

Documentation: Prioritized code readability by including detailed headers and comments for better maintainability.
